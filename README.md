We have tried to implemented all the four criteria which were assigned by Rocco. So the following UI components placed are:

## - Fixed Header : 
When the user scrolls down the header of a specific section is fixed to top.

## - Heading Landmarks :
As you will move from one section to another , you can notice the change in navigation bar. Whichever section is selected that link is marked with different color.

## - Controlled Content Reveal (Image Slide) :
The image changes automatically occurs for every 'x' time interval.

## - Simulate infinite content:
As you will reach the bottom of the page you will observe that it loads the content.
