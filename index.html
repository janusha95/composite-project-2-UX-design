          <h2 class="header" >Cookies</h2>
          <p>It’s thanks to Christina’s chocolate chip cookie recipe that I discovered the wonders of this one special ingredient that makes all the difference.Milk Powder!Have you ever used powdered milk in chocolate chip cookies or any cookies for that matter?Before coming across Christina’s recipe, it had never occurred to me to use milk powder in anything except my California Emergency Earthquake Preparedness Kit. Milk powder, also called powdered milk, keeps forever in the pantry (which is why it’s so good in emergency kits). Even once the package is opened, milk powder will keep for several months if kept in an airtight containe.</p>
          <p>But nibbling on the first cookie in the batch, I was amazed by the subtle caramel flavor and slightly chewy texture it gave her chocolate chip cookies.Right then and there, I decided that milk powder deserved a spot in more of my cookie recipes — and particularly my signature chocolate chip cookies!Aside from the milk powder, this is a pretty straightforward adaptation of the Toll House chocolate chip cookie recipe — though I daresay I’ve managed to make a few improvements on the classic.</p>
          <p>This chocolate chip cookie recipe makes cookies that are absolutely irresistible on the day they are made: the edges are buttery and crispy, the middles are soft and chewy, and the chocolate chips are perfectly semi-melty. </p>

          <h3>Chocolate chip recipe</h3>  
          <p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                  <li>Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and nuts. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased pans. Watch Now</li>
                  <li>Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are nicely browned. Watch Now</li>
              </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The recipe calls for just half a cup of added sweetener in the form of honey and either coconut sugar or brown sugar.Coconut sugar has gained interest for having a slightly lower glycemic index than standard sugar, but it is more expensive than brown sugar. Both options are perfectly acceptable, particularly since you don’t need much.Because the cake is so moist and flavorful all on its own, no frosting is needed. As a result, this is a cake to satisfy that “chocolate tooth” without jacking up your blood sugar in the same way a more classic cake might.</p>
          <p>The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.[13][14]</p>
          <p>One of the magical upsides to these cakes is that they’re delicious warm from the oven and just as good later that day or the next. If you do want to make them ahead, just wedge them from the cupcake tin and store in a covered container. Any leftovers will hold up well stored in the fridge for several days.And yes, these mini cakes are absolutely freezer-friendly. Once completely cool, wrap a layer of plastic wrap around each cake and stow in a resealable freezer bag. To defrost, unwrap and leave at room temperature for a few hours.</p>

          <h2 class="header" >Macroons</h2>
          <p>It’s   been a helluva long time coming!! Light, airy, meringue-like, beautiful French macarons have been on my baking bucket list for a few years. I’ve been studying, testing, and driving myself crazy in the kitchen for months trying to get these things right. I’ve never been more determined and with perseverance comes success</p>          
          <p>The base ingredients for these French macaron cookies are almond flour, confectioners’ sugar, and room temperature egg whites. You can make your own almond flour at home by pulsing blanched, skinless, unsalted, raw almonds until fine. However, buying a package is easier and you get the super-fine texture needed for macaron batter. I like Bob’s Red Mill brand. I find this in my regular grocery store in the baking aisle.</p>
          <p>A kitchen scale is required for the best results. You know I’m a stickler for using a scale! Accurate measurements = accurate results. I’m actually encouraging you to NOT use US cup measurements for this recipe, as there is way too much room for error. Whenever I made macarons based off of cup measurements (2/3 cup this; 3/4 cup that), I messed up the cookies every single time. They tasted “fine” but not authentic. And they didn’t look very pretty, either!</p>  
          <div><img  src="image/unnamed.jpg" alt="An example placeholder image"></div>
          <p>French macarons are delicate cookies with a crunchy exterior and weightless interior. They have a nougat-like, chewy texture and can be filled with anything from frosting and salted caramel to lemon curd and chocolate ganache. If there’s one thing to know before beginning French macarons at home, it’s this: these cookies are not simple. Impossible? Absolutely not. Requiring BOTH patience and practice? Yes</p>

          <p>Before you get all excited to frost the cake and start placing your candies, it’s best to do a little planning session. Start by placing your candies out on a flat surface so you can get a rhythm going. Here’s what my design looks like out on the table. If you want to recreate this same geometric pattern, just copy my design as a guide. Another option would be solid rows, in traditional rainbow form </p>
          <h3>BEGIN FROSTING THE CAKE</h3>
          <p> With your crumb coated cake on the turntable, frost the top of the cake with a thin, level layer of buttercream. Next, frost the sides of the cake and smooth them with your icing scraper, ensuring that they’re as smooth and straight as can be. Don’t smooth out the top edges just yet.</p>
          <div><img src="image/k_archive_d5ca48b91162eb56744a5f2f27e7233fffde3f7b.jpeg" alt="An example placeholder image"></div>
          <h3>TAKE MEASUREMENTS </h3>
          <p>Before you smooth the top edges of the cake, measure the sides of the cake with a straight ruler or bench scraper that shows measurements. You’ll use this measurement to see how many rows of M&M’s you’ll need to reach the top, and also see if you need to add more buttercream to the top of the cake to compensate for the top row.Using your measurement of the height of the cake, measure the amount of M&M rows you’ll need to reach the top using the flat pattern you created in Step 1. If you need more buttercream added to the top, now is the time to add that additional buttercream.</p>
          <div><img src="image/image.jpeg" alt="An example placeholder image"></div>
          <p>The Devil’s Food cake has a nice tender crumb. Using a touch of black cocoa deepens the chocolate flavor and color. If you can’t find black cocoa, regular Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa will work just fine. The filling and frosting is fairly unconventional. It can be a bit tricky to work with, but the fudgy flavor is so worth it. If at any time it is giving you trouble, pop the cake back into the fridge to help the pudding stiffen back up. When it comes to adding the cake crumbs to the sides and top of the cake, use this opportunity to press any sliding layers back into place.</p>
          <p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cocoa powder, water, milk, and ¼ cup sugar. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer.Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining ½ cup of sugar in a separate mixing bowl. Just before the milk mixture simmers, stir the cornstarch into the egg mixture.Temper the simmering milk into the egg mixture by slowly whisking in a little bit of the hot milk at a time. Return the egg-milk mixture back to the saucepan and heat over medium-low.Cook the pudding mixture, while slowly stirring, until it thickens and large bubbles pop at the surface. Add the chopped chocolate and butter. Whisk until completely smooth.Strain the pudding with a mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla and the salt. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding and chill in the refrigerator until completely cool and thick, about 4 hours or overnight.</p>
          <p>Whip up a small batch of buttercream by mixing the butter and sugar until combined. Add the milk and vanilla, then mix on medium-high until light and creamy. Tint the buttercream your color of choice and mix to combine.Place the buttercream in a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Holding the piping bag straight down, pipe stars around the top of the cake. Place dragees or sugar pearls on the tops of the stars.</p>

          <h2 class="header" >Donuts</h2>
          <p>Dealing with dough. The very first step in creating donuts is blooming your yeast: dissolve sugar into lukewarm water, then stir in the yeast. In about 5 minutes, it’ll have turned into a foamy, bubbling layer on top of the water. This is how you know your yeast is alive and that your dough will rise! Stir in with your other ingredients, mix, and then knead until dough feels smooth and elastic. To test if your dough is ready, lightly press your thumb into the dough. In about 5 seconds or so, the dough should bounce almost completely back.</p>
          <div><img src="image/Lees+Donuts-5.jpg  " alt="An example placeholder image"></div>
          <p> Make your glaze in a large, wide bowl for easy coating. Next, make sure to glaze your donuts while they're still warm! This way, it'll stick much better...plus, then you can eat them while they're warm. Once you dip your donuts into the glaze, place onto a cooling rack set over a baking sheet to let the excess drip off. This makes for much easier clean up and evenly glazed donuts. If you want, you can add sprinkles (or chocolate chips, or toasted coconut flakes, etc.) at this point!</p>
          <p>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remain</p>
          <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up.</p>
